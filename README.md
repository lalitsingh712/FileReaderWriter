File Handling in Java – Word & Line Counter

A Java console application built as part of my internship at Codveda Technologies.
This project demonstrates how to read data from a file, process it (word & line count), and write results to another file using Java I/O streams.

🚀 Features

Reads data from a text file (input.txt)

Counts total lines and words

Writes the processed result into another file (output.txt)

Handles file-related exceptions (FileNotFoundException, IOException)

Clean and efficient implementation using BufferedReader & BufferedWriter

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java (JDK 8+)
